Blog Post: Day 1 - Setting Up the Backend and Frontend for Our E-Commerce Web Application

Introduction:
Today marks the beginning of our journey to build a full-fledged e-commerce web application. The focus of Day 1 was on setting up the foundational elements: the backend using Flask and the frontend using React.js. Here’s a detailed walkthrough of the steps we took to get everything up and running.

1. Project Overview:
Our goal is to develop a secure, fully functional e-commerce site. The project will involve learning and applying concepts in backend development, frontend development, secure programming, and data structures and algorithms (DSA).

Technologies Chosen:

```
Backend: Flask (Python)
Frontend: React.js (JavaScript)
Development Environment: Visual Studio Code
```

2. Setting Up the Backend with Flask:

Flask was chosen for its simplicity and flexibility, making it an ideal choice for the backend of our project. Here's how we set it up:

Step 1: Install Flask
We began by setting up a virtual environment and installing Flask to ensure that our project dependencies are isolated.


`python -m venv venv  # Create a virtual environment`
`source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment`
`pip install Flask  # Install Flask`

Step 2: Create a Simple Flask App
We created a basic Flask app to verify our setup. This involved writing a few lines of code in app.py to create a simple "Hello, World!" application.

```
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Hello, World!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```
Explanation:

Flask Import: This imports the Flask class.
app = Flask(__name__): Initializes the Flask application.
@app.route('/'): Defines a route for the home page.
def home(): The function that runs when the home page is accessed.
app.run(debug=True): Runs the Flask app in debug mode for easier development.


1. Setting Up the Frontend with React.js:

React.js was chosen for its flexibility and component-based architecture, which is well-suited for building dynamic user interfaces.

Step 1: Install Node.js and npm
Node.js is essential for running React, and npm is used to manage packages. We installed Node.js from the official website and verified the installation using:

`node -v`
`npm -v`

Step 2: Create a React App
We used the create-react-app tool to quickly scaffold a new React application within our frontend directory.

`npx create-react-app frontend`

Step 3: Run the React App
Finally, we navigated into the frontend directory and started the development server:

`cd frontend`
`npm start`

This launched the default React application in the browser at `http://localhost:3000/`, confirming that our setup was successful.

1. Development Environment:
We chose Visual Studio Code for this project due to its lightweight nature and strong support for both Python and JavaScript development. All setup and code editing were done within VS Code.

Conclusion:
Day 1 was all about laying the groundwork. With both the backend and frontend now set up and running, we’re ready to dive into the core development of our e-commerce site. Stay tuned as we move on to Day 2, where we’ll begin integrating these components and building out the features of the application.

Next Steps:
On Day 2, we will start the integration of the backend and frontend, and possibly begin implementing some core features of the e-commerce site.
